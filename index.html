  <p>You see I say it was because of the dance and that's obviously right but i knew there was a specific moment that happened which made me go damn she freakinnnnngggg beautiful. Scrolling through my camera roll for this project is where I found it. IT WAS THE DANCE VIDEO  you sent everyone with you and your sister in it that actually had me. I was just randomly scrolling through my camera roll looking for our photos when I saw that and was like holy damn that was the moment. That was the moment I SAW THE ONEEEE 🥳🥰😍😋🍴❤️❤️   </p></p>
