  <h2>🌙 How We Started</h2>
  <p>You see I say it was because of the dance and that's obviously right but I knew there was a specific moment that happened which made me go damn she freakinnnnngggg beautiful. Scrolling through my camera roll for this project is where I found it. IT WAS THE DANCE VIDEO  you sent everyone with you and your sister in it that actually had me. I was just randomly scrolling through my camera roll looking for our photos when I saw that and was like holy damn that was the moment. That was the moment I SAW THE ONEEEE 🥳🥰😍😋🍴❤️❤️   </p></p>

      <h2>💫 What You Mean to Me</h2>
      <p>I don't think there's enough words or explanations that would show how much you mean to me. Everything in my life has gotten so much better since you have entered it and filled it with your presence. I got so much to say that my brains being overloaded to the max and it's not coming out in words 😭. My princess, my love there's not a single day I can imagine where I can go without talking to you or seeing your face, even if it does have to be online or through call🥲. You brighten my day in anything and everything you do and even if I've had a shit day, seeing messages from you will instantly make me feel so much better. The way you make me feel is genuinely indescribable. The way you have me smiling-grinning-warm/fuzzy feeling is something I'd never thought I get. With you I feel at home and at peace, a feeling that's very far and few between these days being away from everyone.</p>

      <h2>💌 A Letter</h2>

      <p>To MY BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS,</p>

      <p>
        Happy Valentine's Day my Amooma. Consider this one more of my letters while I'm away but the digital format you feel. OUR FIRST EVER VALENTINES DAY TOGETHER YIPEEEEEEE 🥳🥳🥳🥳. Though this is definitely not how I would want to spend our first Valentine's Day together and I would love to be there with you and SQUEEEEZINGGGGG you to the max and giving everything you deserve, God's had some other plans for us. However knowing you are my Valentine, the most gorgeous, stunning, thoughtful, kind, selfless and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious gives me some solace. Everything about you and your are is perfect. I want this to be a constant reminder of how amazing you are and how much I love and appreciate you. I know you like your computer and coding and though this is a very basic website and definitely not as good as your stuff I hope you still like this. I want this to be a place where you can come back whenever you're feeling not that well or  even pissed at me for something I've done 🤣 (hopefully not back here that many times for this reason) just to remind yourself how much you mean to mean and you are quite literally both my world 🌎 and my universe 🌌. I hope this is a place that can show you how much I love you and place where you can feel a tiny bit of that happiness which you make me feel like.
